# Brad Barrish's User Guide

## What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
	* Good communication is central to having any relationship with me
	* I have an attention problem. While it’s not been professionally diagnosed, I distract easily. I’ve been working on this for a long time and I suspect I will continue to do so until I’m dead.
	* I’m an introvert. This surprises a lot of people because I’m not a stereotypical introvert. I really enjoy one-on-one conversations, even conversations with a few people, but any more than that and I will probably be quieter than usual. 
	* I have high expectations of people, which is a reflection of the standards to which I hold myself, which I often feel I cannot meet, which often results in acute cases of Imposter Syndrome and feelings of inferiority
	* I cry easily
	* Very little offends me.
	
## What drives you nuts?
	* People who can’t communicate well or aren’t willing to try. 
	* Shortcuts
	* Quitters
	* Cheaters
	* “It's not my job”
	* Politics
	* Bureaucracy
	* Sticklers for rules
	* Laziness
	* Ass kissing
	
## What are your quirks?
	* I swear a lot, much to my mom’s chagrin
	* My passion can be misinterpreted as aggression
	* My quiet can be misinterpreted as aloofness
	* I get fussy about design-y things and can fixate on minute details
	* I'm open, sometimes unfiltered, blunt, honest and scrappy. I don't like being told “no” and will often relentlessly pursue making a “no” a “yes”. Sometimes these characteristics can be misinterpreted. 
	* I wear almost the same thing every day
	* I hydrate almost exclusively with carbonated water and the first thing I ask for at a restaurant is to remove my glass of non-carbonated water and replace it with carbonated water.
	* I’m known to fact check people during conversations 
	* I ask ‘why’ a lot

## How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
	* Engage me
	* Be prepared (value people’s)
	* Before you assume harm or ill intent, pull me aside so we can have a conversation about how you're feeling so I can address it and we begin working through it.
	* Communicate with me constantly and candidly
	* Speak openly, honestly and demand the same from me (it’s the way I am anyway, so hopefully you don’t have to prompt me often)
	* Call me out when you don't agree with me, an idea I expressed, how I expressed something or anything else that rubs you the wrong way.

## What qualities do you particularly value in people who work with you?
	* You care deeply about the work you do, no matter how significant or insignificant it may be
	* Exceptional communication skills, both written and spoken
	* Honesty above everything
	* Confidence and strong sense of self
	* Extraordinary attention to details that matter and not sweating the ones that don’t. 
* What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
	* See my quirks above
	* I expect a lot from others, but I’m patient, understanding and willing to work with someone to improve.
	* I consume a lot of information on a daily basis. I read a lot. I scan even more and I like to share things with others. This is a natural impulse for me. There is no expectation that people comment or even acknowledge my shares, but it’s nice when it happens. 

## How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
	* I try to ask a lot of questions
	* Never focus on retaining someone at the expense of advancing their career.
	* Hold people accountable to what they tell me they want to do
	* Bring opportunities to the table
	* Generally speaking, a lot of communication and interaction is required for me to get to know someone to suss out how I can be helpful.
	* I’ve been told by people, friends and family members that I’m attuned to people and have spent a lot of time cultivating that so I can be a better person, friend and manager.
	* I’m good at assessing people’s strengths through the synthesis of conversations and interactions which helps me identify strengths (and weaknesses). I combine that skill with honest communication to bring out the best in people.

## What’s the best way to communicate with you?
	* Be open, be vulnerable, be honest

## What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
	* Help me understand the value in relation to what I believe are the most important things. 
	* Appeal to reason, have data or research to support your ask and don’t veil your ask behind something else unless you can hide it very well.

## How do you like to give feedback?
	* Often. I do not let things fester. If I have feedback, I will think about it and then be very anxious to give it to you.

## How do you like to get feedback?
	* See above about how I like to give feedback.

## What moment, person or piece of advice shaped who you are today?
	* Being raised by parents that allowed me space to make some terrific mistakes and were willing to talk through them without judgement.
