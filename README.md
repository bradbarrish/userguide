# About my user manual
This is a living document for people that work with me now and in the future. I've never documented this before now and was inspired to do by reading user giudes from other people. While at Sonos we went through this exercise as a leadership team and I really enjoyed it so I asked my own team to do the exercise. 

## Inspiration
The very first user manual I read, and it's probably the best one out there, was by [Michael Lopp (a.k.a. Rands)](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands/), who I think anyone who care about management should be reading regularly. He's just such a wonderful writer, which made his especially pleasant to read. The first pass at my own was basically a copy of his, but that's not what I ultimatley ended up using. I came to know of David Politis, CEO of BetterCloud, by reading [Brad Feld's blog](https://www.feld.com/). David wrote a post on LinkedIn (I know, I know...) called ["This is How You Revolutionize the Way Your Team Works Together... And All It Takes is 15 Minutes"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-you-revolutionize-way-your-team-works-together-all-david-politis/). I used his framework and added a bonus question that was taken from the Sonos user manual framework. 

If you want to read through even more user manuals by an impressive list of execs (almost all dude, unfortunately), [Brennan McEachran aggregated a bunch of them on Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe).

Speaking of kick-ass women that inspire me on this front, shout out to Lara Hogan, who has [a bunch of great resources](https://larahogan.me/resources/) on her site.
